The web page travelworld.html is both for launching a travel scene and scenery/services administration.
It should be a really thin client to be prepared to easily
implement the same in a VR lobby scene. Even leaflet might be too rich, but building eg. a https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JMapViewer based
server side solution needs great effords. So stay with the very convenient leaflet for now.
